# LoL Queue

The idea is to create a virtual queue of thousands of fake players, and match
them up to make league games the way League of Legends would, by role.

## Goals

I am thinking some kind of interface should be made so that I can benchmark
several different algorithms and supporting technologies/backends. For example,
is a DB useful here? Do it all in memory? etc.

Hopefully I'll learn something cool, it sounded like a nice fun little oneoff.
